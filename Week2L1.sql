-------------------- Questions ------------------------

* The HR department needs a report to display the employee number, last name, salary, and salary increased by 15.5% (expressed as a whole number) for each employee. Label the column New Salary.

* For each employee, display the last name and calculate the number of months between today and the date on which the employee was hired. Label the column MONTHS_WORKED. Order your results by the number of months employed.

* Create a query to display the last name and the number of weeks employed for all employees in department 90. Label the number of weeks column as TENURE. Truncate the number of weeks value to 0 decimal places. Show the records in descending order of the employeeâ€™s tenure.
