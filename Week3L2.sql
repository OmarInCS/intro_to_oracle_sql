-------------------- Questions ------------------------
* Create a report that displays the employee number, last name, and salary of all employees who earn more than the average salary. Sort the results in ascending order by salary.

* Create a report for HR that displays the department 
number, last name, and job ID for every employee in 
the Executive department.

* The HR department wants to determine the names of all employees who were hired after Davies. Create a query to display the name and hire date of any employee hired after employee Davies.

-- 2000 kahoot points
* The HR department needs a query that prompts the 
user for an employeeâ€™s last name. The query then 
displays the last name and hire date of any employee 
in the same department as the employee whose name 
the user supplies (excluding that employee).

* The HR department needs a report that displays the 
last name, department number, and job ID of all 
employees whose department location ID is 1700.
